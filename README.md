This python script uses the shelve module to store a simple incrementing count for each file you copy from the Windows spotlight folder. This count will be appended onto the new name of the image. The naming of the file follows this format:

[date]_[imageNumber]

Run this script to create a folder on your desktop titled "Spotlight_Images" that will store the images currently being used for the Windows Spotlight feature.
